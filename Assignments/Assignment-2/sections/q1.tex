\section*{Problem 1}

\textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}

\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*), noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Bishop exercise 12.1 for the proof that the first M principal components correspond to the directions corresponding to the M largest eigenvectors of the covariance matrix (refer to Bishop page number 561--563 for problem formulation and proof for \( \mathrm{M}=1 \) and then prove for any arbitrary M by induction).
          This problem starts from the maximum variance formulation of PCA.\@

    \item Show that the minimum reconstruction error formulation of the PCA is equivalent to the maximum variance formulation.
\end{enumerate}
