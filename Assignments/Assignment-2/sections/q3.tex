\section*{Problem 3}

\textbf{K-means and its relation to the EM algorithm}\\
In this problem, we will show that the K-means algorithm is a special case of EM algorithm applied to GMM.\@
Consider a Gaussian Mixture Model with K components
\[
    p(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \Pi_{k} \mathcal{N}\left(x \mid \mu_{k}, \Sigma_{k}\right)
\]
Now, suppose that each of the covariance matrices, \( \Sigma_{k}=\epsilon I \) for all \( k=1,2, \ldots, K \).
Then, show that the limiting case, \( \epsilon \rightarrow 0 \) is equivalent to K-means clustering.
