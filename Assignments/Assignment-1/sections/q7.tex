\section*{Problem 7}

\textbf{(Support Vector Machines-II: \( l_{2}
    \) norm soft margin SVM)}
The \( l_{2} \) norm soft margin SVM algorithm is given by the following optimization problem:
\[
    \min _{w, b, \xi} \quad \frac{1}{2}\|w\|^{2}+\frac{C}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \xi_{i}^{2} \quad \text { s.t } \quad y^{(i)}\left(w^{T} x^{(i)}+b\right) \geq 1-\xi_{i}, i=1, \ldots, m
\]

(a) Notice that the constrains \( \xi_{i} \geq 0 \) have been dropped. Show that these nonnegativity constraints can be removed. That is, the optimal value of the objective will be the same whether or not these constraints are present.\\
(b) What is the Lagrangian of the \( l_{2} \) norm soft margin SVM optimization problem?\\
(c) Minimize the Lagrangian with respect to \( w, b \), and \( \xi \).\\
(d) What is the dual of the \( l_{2} \) norm soft margin SVM optimization problem?
