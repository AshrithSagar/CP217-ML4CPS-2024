\section*{Problem 3}

\textbf{(Gradient descent, L2 regularization, and variational calculus)}\\
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*), noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Show that a first-order gradient descent always leads to a decrease in the function value for smooth functions.

    \item Show that L2 regularization leads to a 'decay' term in the gradient descent. What is the term?

    \item (Bishop, Exercise problem 1.25) Taking motivation for the result 1.89 in Bishop, prove the same result for multidimensional case, as given in exercise problem 1.25.\\
          P.S If interested, you can look up exercise problem 1.27 of Bishop.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) First-order gradient descent for smooth functions}

\subsubsection*{(b) L2 regularization and the ``decay'' term}

\subsubsection*{(c) Multidimensional case}
