\section*{Problem 4}

\textbf{(Neural Networks-I)}\\
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*), noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Can a neural network with the usual sigmoid activations be replaced by another neural network with only tanh activations without altering the input-output relations for any data?

    \item Suppose we have four datapoints with binary features as follows:\\
          \( \{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\} \) with the respective labels as \( \{0,1,1,0\} \).
          Verify whether a 3-layer MLP with all linear layers(without any non-linear activations) can learn to separate the data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) Replacing sigmoid activations with tanh activations}

\subsubsection*{(b) 3-layer MLP with all linear layers}
