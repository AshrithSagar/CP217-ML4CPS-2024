# Are you in a safe building?

<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/are-you-in-a-safe-building>

Predict the building type/material for their ability to sustain earthquake loads.

## Usage

- Keep the dataset under `Codes/dataset`
- The runs and each experiment are stored under `Codes/experiments` with a corresponding experiment folder
- The trials are carried out in `Codes/notebooks`
- The `Codes/utils` folder contains utility classes that can be imported in the notebooks and directly used, wherever needed, which keeps the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Notes

- The `ml4cps-submission.ipynb` contains the code for the best model that was trained. (Run on Kaggle).
